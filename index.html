<h1>This is the Playlist Project</h1>

<p>The Playlist Project is a list of themed playlists, shared by their creators for the enjoyment of anyone interested. Each playlist has been curated around a theme, with the length being around 60 minutes. Each month there is a new theme. To contribute, you can create a <a href="https://github.com/Wat-Poods/playlistproject">pull request</a>. If you are unfamiliar with <a href="www.github.com">GitHub</a> and would still like to contribute, you can submit a link to <a mailto:"pat@patwoods.co">pat@patwoods.co</a>. Email submissions will be updated as time allows.
