# Playlist Project
## A list of themed playlists

### What it is
This is a list of themed playlists. I'll update it from time to time, but I created it here on GitHub so you can help out. 

The current plan is to have a new theme every month. If I have more free time, or if I get some assistance, we could increase the frequency to every two weeks. 

For every theme, there will be a list. The list will include a link to the playlist, a flag for Spotify or Apple Music, and the contributor's name. To increase dialogue about the music, I'd like to link each person to a social media account. 

### Participation 

If you want to contribute a list, the best way would be to [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your link. 

### Background 

I love music. I love hearing new music. I do not think this is unique to me. 

Growing up, the most consistent way for hearing  new music for me was the mix tape. I still have my mix tapes. Two shoe boxes of cassettes of curated music: 

- the one of hardcore bands a coworker gave me at my first job (Thanks, Chad!)
- the mix tapes my friends and I created, shared, and probably stole from each other growing up
- the ones my significant other and I gave to each other while we were dating. 

The tracks are a testament to my youth and growing up. But they also exposed me to so many bands and songs I love. 

#### Thinking Good Good Things...
I've tried to participate in groups that make mixes to share with people. They always fizzled out. From the one where I mailed mixed cds to a different set of people each month to one where someone would update a Wordpress site with submissions from people, they all had one big problem: one person trying to carry the whole thing. They either got burned out, or were a bottle neck, and people stopped participating. That's why this is on GitHub.

This project combines my love of music and my interest in open source. My intention is to set up the project, but not to _run_ it. I know I don't have time for that, and I knpow from experience, this won't work if it's all on one person.

### Ground Rules
To help this, I've set up some ground rules, which could change:

- The site will stay simple. The aesthetic of the site is less important than the ease of collaborative participation. 
- Version control is our friend: if the site gets messed up, it can be fixed way easier this way.
