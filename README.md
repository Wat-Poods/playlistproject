# Playlist Project
## A list of themed playlists

###What it is
This is a list of themed playlists. I'll update it from time to time, but I created it here on GitHub so you can help out. 

The current plan is to have a new theme every month. If I have more free time, or if I get some assistance, we could increase the frequency to every two weeks. 

For every theme, there will be a list. The list will include a link to the playlist, a flag for Spotify or Apple Music, and the contributor's name. To increase dialogue about the music, I'd like to link each person to a social media account. 

###Participation 

If you want to contribute a list, the best way would be to [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your link. 

###Background 

I love music, and I love hearing new music. The most consistent way for learning about new music for me has always been the mix tape. I still have my mix tapes. Two shoe boxes of cassettes of currated music: the one of hardcore bands a coworker gave me at my first job, the mix tapes my friends and I created, shared, and probably stole from each other growing up, to the ones my significant other and I gave to each other while we were dating. The tracks are a testament to my youth and growing up. But they also exposed me to so many bands and songs I love. 

I've tried to participate in groups that make mixes to share with people. They always fizzled out. From the one where I mailed mixed cds to a set of people each month to one where someone would update a Wordpress site with submissions from people, they all had one big problem: one person trying to carry the whole thing. They weither got burned out, or were a bottle neck, and people stopped participating. That's why this is one GitHub. Don't make me drive this entirely myself.
