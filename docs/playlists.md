# Playlists

<!--
This section is notes. They are here to help guide people new to markdown & to the playlist project. This text is on the same file that serves as the website, but you can't see it in the browser.
If you're creating a new theme, Start a new line, and format it this way:

### NewTheme Here

Then the link to the playlist:

Below is a snippet that can be copied/pasted below to add your playlist. 
- [Name of Playlist](http://www.playlisturl.com), Apple Music or Spotify, submitted by [Person](http://www.whateverlinkyouwanttoincludehere)

I've tried to be as plan speak in what each section requires. Important to know, should you not know `markdown`: 
- One space between the hyphen `-` and the first character for the bullted list to appear correctly.
[Link Name](and link address) There should NOT be a space between ` ](`, or the link won't work.
